<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p class="lead">This toolbox facilitates linking brain connectivity with task-evoked activity and associated cognitive/behavioral functions. The primary focus is on <em>activity flow mapping</em> and related methods (<a href="http://rdcu.be/kOJq">Cole et al. (2016)</a> & <a href="http://rdcu.be/wQ1M">Ito et al. (2017)</a>).</p>

<p class="lead">Activity flow mapping is based on core principles underlying brain network simulations, applying these principles to empirical neural/neuroimaging data. It is a highly flexible framework that is constantly being improved via better connectivity methods and creative uses of the approach to better understand brain function.</p>

<p class="lead">Activity flow mapping can be used, for instance, to infer whether one or more brain connections are involved in producing a particular function. This method can also be used to relate multiple task-evoked activations to each other (e.g., predicting one neural population's activity from another's activity). More generally, activity flow mapping can be thought of as creating <em>network coding models</em> (<a href="http://www.colelab.org/pubs/2019_ItoHearne_TiCS.pdf">Ito et al. (2020)</a>), which are empirically-constrained neural network models.</p>

<p class="lead">Other methods included in the toolbox (which can optionally be used along with activity flow mapping) are advanced versions of resting-state functional connectivity and task-state functional connectivity. The primary focus (for now) is on fMRI data, but in principle these approaches can be applied to any kind of neural data.</p>

<p class="lead">This code repository was created by the Cole Neurocognition Lab at Rutgers University: <a href="http://www.colelab.org/">http://www.colelab.org/</a>
<br>We are happy for others to contribute to the code as well.</p>

<p class="lead">See the <strong><a href="HCP_example.html">example notebook</a></strong> to see the Actflow Toolbox in action<br>
  We provide 30 subjects' data from the Human Connectome Project for trying out the toolbox</p>

<h3 id="core-algorithm-and-principles-behind-activity-flow-mapping">Core algorithm and principles behind activity flow mapping</h3>
<p class="lead">Activity flow mapping is a method validated and published in Nature Neuroscience in 2016 (see <a href="http://rdcu.be/kOJq">Cole et al. (2016)</a>), with multiple follow-up studies further validating the approach.</p>
<h4>Activity flow mapping has two basic steps:</h4>
<p>1) <em>Activity flow modeling</em>: Simulating the flow (movement) of activity between neural populations, using empirical data to estimate activity levels and routes of flow (connectivity). This is done by running the standard &quot;propagation rule&quot; and &quot;activation rule&quot; steps used in most neural network simulations (see <a href="http://www.colelab.org/pubs/2019_ItoHearne_TiCS.pdf">Ito et al. (2020)</a>). In the standard approach each neural population&#39;s activity level is predicted based on the flow from every other recorded neural population (from <a href="http://rdcu.be/kOJq">Cole et al. (2016)</a>):</p>
<p><img width="350" src="images/actflowfigure1.png"></p>
<p>2) <em>Testing prediction accuracy</em>: The predicted brain activity pattern is compared to the actual recorded activity, providing evidence for or against the activity flow model used to make the predictions. Predictions of multiple models can be compared to quantify model validity. Two examples of predicted-to-actual accuracy testing with fMRI data (from <a href="http://rdcu.be/kOJq">Cole et al. (2016)</a>):</p>
<p><img width="350" src="images/actflowfigure_predictiontesting.png"></p>
<p>In principle, any measure of neural activity and any measure of neural connectivity (e.g., structural connectivity) can be used with activity flow mapping. Some modifications are necessary for fast temporal resolution data such as EEG/MEG or multi-unit recording, but these should be available soon (we are working on it!).</p>

<h2 id="guidelinesforactflow">General guidelines for activity flow mapping</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid <a href="https://wiki.biac.duke.edu/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=biac:kriegeskorte_et_al_2009.pdf">circularity</a>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use connectivity independent of the to-be-predicted state when possible</strong>, such as resting-state functional connectivity. This implicitly tests for generalization across brain states (when predicting task activations), which is important given that connectivity is mostly invariant across states. There is substantial evidence for the dominant effect of intrinsic/state-general connectivity (see <a href="http://www.colelab.org/pubs/2014_Cole_Neuron.pdf">Cole et al. (2014)</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2018.03.035">Gratton et al. (2018)</a>). Using structural connectivity also avoids this issue, though some details (e.g., the aggregate effects of synaptic weights) are lost with most structural connectivity methods.</li>
      <li><strong>Ensure statistical independence of activation and functional connectivity estimates</strong> when the same state is used for estimating both. The recommended approach is to use finite impulse response (FIR) regression as a preprocessing step, removing the to-be-predicted mean task activations prior to estimating task-state functional connectivity. Note that this leaves most of the task-related variance in the time series, since mean task effects are only a small (but important; which is why we try to predict them via activity flow mapping) portion of the data. See <a href="http://www.colelab.org/pubs/ColeEtAl2019NeuroImage.pdf">Cole et al. (2019)</a> for more info.</li>
      <li><strong>Spatial smoothness of the data can introduce circularity</strong>, since this results in the same underlying neural activity being assigned to multiple spatial locations (such as multiple voxels in fMRI). We therefore recommend excluding activity flow source data within approximately 10 mm from the to-be-predicted neural signal with fMRI data (see <a href="http://rdcu.be/kOJq">Cole et al. (2016)</a>). This is less of a concern with brain region level data, since it would only apply to voxels/vertices at the border of each region. We nonetheless implemented a "non-circular" version of region-level activity analysis (excluding regions within 10 mm of the to-be-predicted region), which is demonstrated in the <a href="HCP_example.html">example notebook</a>. The vast majority of results do not change with vs. withou the "non-circular" region-level approach. Note that standard activity flow mapping should not be used with EEG/MEG or related methods at this time, since the source spread implicit in those approaches is so substantial (even when using source localization) that it would result in substantial circularity. (We are working on an approach to get around this problem, however.)</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
  <li>Compare-then-average vs. average-then-compare:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>We recommend compare-then-average statistics for most analyses</strong> (the default option in the actflowtest function). Compare-then-average compares each subject's predicted to actual activity prior to aggregating results across subjects, such that the group-level estimate is representative of individual subject results (i.e., what would be expected if the analysis was run with a new random subject). In contrast, the average-then-compare approach averages results across subjects prior to comparing predicted to actual activity. This typically boosts predicted-to-actual similarity due to more data being included in both the predicted and actual estimates, as well as due to "bluring"/smoothing the data from cross-subject averaging. It also prevents computation of meaningful p-values, since there is no inter-subject variance in prediction accuracy to use for t-tests and similar approaches. Note, however, that visualizing group results (plotting predicted and actual activation patterns next to each other) effectively results in the average-then-compare approach, since results are averaged prior to the reader comparing the results by eye. Thus, predicted-to-actual similarity typically appears higher in these plots than they are at the individual subject level.
