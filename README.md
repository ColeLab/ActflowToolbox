# ActflowToolbox
## The Brain Activity Flow ("Actflow") Toolbox
A toolbox to facilitate discovery of how cognition & behavior are generated via brain network interactions

## Version 0.3.0

## Visit [https://colelab.github.io/ActflowToolbox/](https://colelab.github.io/ActflowToolbox/) for more information

### Version info:
* Version 0.3.0: Added Glasso FC to the set of connectivity methods (new recommended best practice for activity flow mapping); see updated HCP_example Jupyter notebook for a demo [2023-09-24]
* Version 0.2.6: Added combinedFC to the set of connectivity methods (current recommended best practice for activity flow mapping); see updated HCP_example Jupyter notebook for a demo
* Version 0.2.5: Fixed minor bug related to applying parcel level non-circular code to subcortical data.
* Version 0.2.4: Updated the non-circular code to be more efficient. Also created an easier and faster version of the non-circular approach that is at the parcel level (excluding all parcels within 10mm of the target parcel).

## How to install

1) git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ColeLab/ActflowToolbox.git
2) We recommend using Anaconda (for Python 3), with JupyterLab (or Jupyter Notebooks). Many of the Python package dependencies for Actflow Toolbox will be included in Anaconda. You may need to add additional packages, however, such as GGlasso. For example, to add GGlasso, run this from the command line (after installing Anaconda): pip install gglasso

## Software development guidelines
* Primary language: Python 3
* Secondary language (for select functions, minimally maintained/updated): MATLAB
* Versioning guidelines: Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 (https://semver.org/); used loosely prior to v1.0.0, strictly after
* Using GitHub for version control
	* Those new to Git should go through a tutorial for branching, etc.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFYyTZwMyAg and https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
	* Use branching for adding new features, making sure code isn't broken by changes
	* Considering using unit tests and Travis CI (https://travis-ci.org) in future
* Style specifications:
	* PEP8 style as general guidelines (loosely applied for now): https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
	* Soft tabs (4 spaces) for indentations [ideally set "soft tabs" setting in editor, so pressing tab key produces 4 spaces]
	* Use intuitive variable and function names
	* Add detailed comments to explain what code does (especially when not obvious)

* _Directory_: actflowcomp - Calculating activity flow mapping
	* actflowcalc.py - Main function for calculating activity flow mapping predictions
	* actflowtest.py - A convenience function for calculating activity-flow-based predictions and testing prediction accuracies (across multiple subjects)
	* noiseceilingcalc.py - A convenience function for calculating the theoretical limit on activity-flow-based prediction accuracies (based on noise in the data being used)
* _Directory_: connectivity_estimation - Connectivity estimation methods
	* calcactivity_parcelwise_noncircular_surface.py: High-level function for calculating parcelwise actflow with parcels that are touching (e.g., the Glasser 2016 parcellation), focusing on task activations. This can create circularity in the actflow predictions due to spatial autocorrelation. This function excludes vertices within X mm (10 mm by default) of each to-be-predicted parcel.
	* calcconn_parcelwise_noncircular_surface.py: High-level function for calculating parcelwise actflow with parcels that are touching (e.g., the Glasser 2016 parcellation), focusing on connectivity estimation. This can create circularity in the actflow predictions due to spatial autocorrelation. This function excludes vertices within X mm (10 mm by default) of each to-be-predicted parcel.

	* partial_corrconn.py: Calculation of partial-correlation functional connectivity
	* pc_multregconn.py: Calculation of regularized multiple-regression functional connectivity using principle components regression (PCR). Useful when there are fewer time points than nodes, for instance.
