# ActflowToolbox
## The Brain Activity Flow ("Actflow") Toolbox

## Version 0.1.0 (alpha version)

## Overview
This toolbox facilitates linking brain connectivity with cognitive/behavioral functions and task-evoked activity. The primary focus is on _activity flow mapping_ (http://rdcu.be/kOJq) and related methods such as _information transfer mapping_ (http://rdcu.be/wQ1M). These approaches can be used to create and test _network coding models_ (http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03612), which are empirically-constrained neural network models.

Other included methods that can be used along with activity flow mapping (or not) include advanced versions of task-state functional connectivity, resting-state functional connectivity, and general linear modeling (multiple regression). Supporting methods such as preprocessing and simulations for validation will also be included [planned]. The primary focus (for now) is on fMRI and EEG/MEG data, but in principle these approaches can be applied to other kinds of data.

This code repository was created by the Cole Neurocognition Lab at Rutgers University: http://www.colelab.org/ We are happy for others to contribute to the code as well (contact Michael Cole if you are interested).

### Core algorithm and principles behind activity flow mapping
Activity flow mapping is a method validated and published in Nature Neuroscience in 2016 (see http://rdcu.be/kOJq), with multiple follow-up studies further validating the approach.

**Activity flow mapping has two major steps**:
1) _Activity flow modeling_: Simulating the flow (movement) of activity between neural populations, using empirical data to estimate activity levels and routes of flow (connectivity). This is done by running the standard "propagation rule" and "activation rule" steps used in most neural network simulations (see http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03612). In the standard approach each neural population's activity level is predicted based on the flow from every other recorded neural population:

2) _Testing prediction accuracy_: The predicted brain activity pattern is compared to the actual recorded activity, providing evidence for or against the activity flow model used to make the predictions. Predictions of multiple models can be compared to quantify model validity.

In principle, any measure of neural activity and any measure of neural connectivity can be used with activity flow mapping. Some modifications are necessary for fast temporal resolution data such as EEG/MEG or multi-unit recording, but these should be available soon (we are working on it!).

## Conventions
* Data matrices all node X time
* Directed connectivity matrices all target X source
* Primary (default) brain parcellation: CAB-NP (https://github.com/ColeLab/ColeAnticevicNetPartition), which uses the Glasser2016 parcellation for cortex (https://balsa.wustl.edu/study/show/RVVG) and includes an additional 358 subcortical parcels. Cortex-only analyses with only the Glasser2016 parcels are easily implemented. Other parcellations can be used, and we anticipate integrating other parcellations in the future.

## Example
Calculating activity flow mapping predictions using multiple-regression FC and standard task-evoked activations with fMRI data (in Python 3; assumes task activations and resting-state fMRI data are already loaded):
```import ActflowToolbox as actflow
restFC_mreg=actflow.connectivity_estimation.multregconn(restdata)
print("==Activity flow mapping results, multiple-regression-based resting-state FC, 24 task conditions==")
actflowOutput_restFCMReg_bycond = actflow.actflowcomp.actflowtest(activations_bycond, restFC_mreg, print_by_condition=False)
```
Output:
```
==Activity flow mapping results, multiple-regression-based resting-state FC, 24 task conditions==
